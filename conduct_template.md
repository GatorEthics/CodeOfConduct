## Categories of Conduct

## Overall Conduct

This section defines how each class member should and should not act while participating in a computer science course. Everyone is required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight sections of this Code of Conduct. Most important in this section is that members respect their peers, regardless of race or gender, as learners. This is a course in which individuals have different skillsets and different levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning a class member for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and using other people's work is a core part of learning how to learn and code effectively, yet when used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work without their permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively impact learning success. Therefore, members of this course should adhere to the college's honor code for all submitted work.

### Attendance

Students are expected to attend class sessions and laboratory sessions in person and remotely depending on what attendance group they were assigned at the start of the semester. In addition to that and due to the nature of the course students should also be expected to communicate and work collaboratively outside of class with team members on a laboratory or project assignment. There are exceptions to this rule that take into account emergencies and illnesses.

## Team Work

Some of the class activities and lab projects will require team collaboration. This section of the Code of Conduct will provide guidance on effective and inclusive team work.

### Participation

Every class member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the class activities and lab projects at hand. This will ensure the flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts in a respectful manner. Our learning environment at its root includes participation, candidness and insightful collaboration. Participating in team-based project discussion means engaging in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and truly be all there.

  - Members shall

    - TODO: Add bullet points

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  - Members shall not

    - TODO: Add bullet points

### Decisions

The majority of individuals in a team should agree on a given decision before the project is implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. One should reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine how long a decision will take to implement.

  - Members shall

    - TODO: Add bullet points

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  - Members shall not

    - TODO: Add bullet points

### Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of the project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was successful and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also provide great insight in how to improve in future projects.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - TODO: Add bullet points

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  - Members shall not

    - TODO: Add bullet points

### Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group. It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

  - Members shall

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

## Infractions

An infraction occurs when class member(s) violate the agreed rules present in the Code of Conduct. Any action that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an infraction. Class member(s) should avoid infractions since the accumulation of them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of previous infractions. Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher level infraction and thus a more severe penalty.

This guideline for infractions is separate from the college's Code guidelines. While the Honor Code involves all students in Allegheny College and is enforced by the college's Honor Committee, this Code of Conduct only includes members of the computer science class.

- _Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity. Technical leaders and instructor will be keeping track of infractions._

- Level I: TODO: add a description 
  
  - TODO: Add bullet points for level I infraction.

- Level II: TODO: add a description 
  
  - TODO: Add bullet points for level I infraction.

- Level III: TODO: add a description 

  - TODO: Add bullet points for level I infraction.

Class member(s) are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure a safe, inclusive and collegiate environment.

Class member(s) may appeal any infraction to the instructor of the class. Any decision made by the instructor for the given infraction(s) will be final.
